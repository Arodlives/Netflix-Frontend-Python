users--> primary table or  table  on the left
addresses--> 2ndary  table or  the  table  on  the right

SELECT  *  FROM users JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id;

if  missing one of the object/table input  
a user with  no object

ON= lines up the puzzle pieces

each  row is a dictionary 
list of dictionaries 

many to many
Double JOINS 
remove the plural  (users_id ----> user_id)

    JOIN cars ON users_has_cars.cars_id=cars.id;

Step 3: selecting by  id  must  specify which  table  id
WHERE users.id = 10;

creating  objects  targeting the primary  object in the model file 

current_timestamp()
current_timestamp() on update current_timestamp()
